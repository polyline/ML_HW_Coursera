### Homework 5 ###

- Linear Regression
- Learning curve, x-axis -> m(using samples), y-axis -> error
- Selecting propriate lambda(Training a lot of times by using different lambda values). Then we should select the lambda value causing both training error and validation error are low.
- In practice, when we plot learning curve, we should rambomly select i samples from the training set and validation set, abd then use the trained theta to calculate errors. 
Repeat the process many times(for examples: 50 times), and use the average to plot learning curve.
